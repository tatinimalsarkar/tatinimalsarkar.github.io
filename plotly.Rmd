I like to eat! Let's investigate some restaurants in the Big Apple.

Chart A depicts American restaurants in NYC, separated by borough. Chart B shows NYC Department of Health scores for Korean restaurants in Manhattan by year of inspection. Chart C shows DOH scores for Chinese restaurants by borough.

Whew! All those charts are making me hungry. Time for a snack!

nyrest_a %>% 
  count(boro) %>% 
  mutate(boro = fct_reorder(boro, n)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~boro, y = ~n, color = ~boro, type = "bar") %>% 
  layout(
